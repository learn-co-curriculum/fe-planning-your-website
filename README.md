### Brainstorming

Start by jotting down the content of your site. Some prefer to make text lists of all the content and then organize similiar content into the same pages. Others like to spend time sketching out the user interface and consider how users will move through the content you present them. Creating a flow chart can give you an idea of how many pages you'll have and how they'll link to each other. Let's go into a little more detail for each of these things on their own.

#### Flow Chart

This diagram can be easily drawn by hand or by using digital tools to create a map of all of your site pages and how they will link together.

#### Mockups

Mockups can also be drawn by hand or by using digital tools. These act as simple plans that reflect the positioning of page content and key elements such as the user interface. Often we use different mockups for different size devices. You might want to create a mobile, tablet, desktop screen, and large size sceen mockups to show how the same content will responsively scale for different size devices.

## Summary

Whatever medium you choose, it is a good idea to organize and plan out the content and user interface for your site ahead of time.
